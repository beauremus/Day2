            <p>Brittney is a custom picture framer by day and a wannabe coder and artist by night. When she isn't playing Horizon Zero Dawn she's trying to decided between animating something and doing her bootcamp homework. C'est la vie. 
                She types pretty slowly, so you'll find her on <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">Typing Club</a> to get her speed up. Another quirk is her love of doodling camels. No one is certain why.
